This folder contains a Global script for the Plugin.

If you are having trouble with the standard script, replace it with this one.

Copy this script into /wp-content/plugins/woo-align-buttons/public/js/wooalign-public.js
to replace the original script.

What's the difference?

This global script has more options to trigger the alignment of the buttons.

It will also trigger on "scroll" and "on mouse move".

The scroll function will help with "Ajax Load More" scripts.

This global script can also be called from other Plugin's by using: wooAlignButtons();
