# Woo Align Buttons
[Resolved] Woocommerce align add to cart buttons

A plugin that aligns WooCommerce 'Add to cart' buttons.

### Description

This lightweight plugin will automatically align your WooCommerce "Add to cart" buttons.

Nothing looks worse than visiting a WooCommerce shop page to find the "Add to cart" buttons scattered all over the place like a dog's breakfast.

This simple plugin solves that problem with a little javascript, and without modifying any core files or templates.
